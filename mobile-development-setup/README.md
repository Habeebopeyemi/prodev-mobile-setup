# üì± Setting Up and Testing Your Mobile Development Environment

## üéØ Objective  
Mobile development requires more computational resources compared to web development. To simplify the setup and testing process, we will be using the **Expo Framework for React Native**, which makes mobile app development easier and faster.  

This task ensures you have the right tools in place for a smooth development experience.

## ‚úÖ Requirements  
Before starting, make sure you have the following installed on your system:  

- **Node.js LTS** (Latest Long-Term Support version)  
- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** (recommended IDE)  
- **Compatible Operating System**: macOS, Linux, or Windows  
- **Expo Go** installed on your **physical device (Android or iOS)**  

These tools are essential for completing upcoming projects efficiently.

## ‚ùì Why Expo Go?  
Unlike web development, mobile app development often requires device emulators to test applications. Running emulators can be costly in terms of **hardware requirements** (e.g., testing across multiple iPhones or Android devices).  

**Expo Go** solves this problem by allowing you to run and test your **React Native applications directly on your physical device**, without requiring expensive hardware setups.  

Benefits of Expo Go:
- Works seamlessly with both **iOS and Android**  
- Fast and cost-effective  
- Easy to set up and use
